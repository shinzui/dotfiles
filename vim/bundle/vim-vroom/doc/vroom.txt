INTRO                                                      *vroom-introduction*

Vroom is a plugin for running you Ruby tests, specs, and features. It allows
you to speed up your development since you don't have to jump around to
different windows or tabs.

If you're hacking away on your awesome Ruby app, and you open your spec, you
can easily run the whole file by hitting <Leader>r, or nearest test with
<Leader>R. This is then remembered, so if you switch back to your code, you
can then hit <Leader>r again and that last test will be run.

INTERFACE                                                     *vroom-interface*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS                                                       *vroom-commands*

:VroomRunTestFile                                            *VroomRunTestFile*
                        Runs the current file if it is a test. Otherwise, run
                        the last test file that was run.

:VroomRunNearestTest                                      *VroomRunNearestTest*

                        Runs the nearest test in the current file if it's a
                        test. Otherwise, runs the last test that was run.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS                                               *vroom-key-mappings*

By default vroom maps <Leader>r to mapped to |VroomRunTestFile| and <Leader>R is
mapped to |VroomRunNearestTest|. This can be turned off by simply putting `let
g:vroom_map_keys = 0` in your vimrc
